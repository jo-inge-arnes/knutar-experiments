# Knutar Experiments
Experiments accompanying the paper [Greedy Knot Selection Algorithm for Restricted Cubic Spline Regression](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2708178/v1).

`example-curves.Rmd` generates figures illustrating ground truth, a_1,
and a_2 curves for a sample.

`knot-removal-figure.Rmd` generates figures showing the effect of removing
inner knots, comparison to standard approach, and how BIC scores are affected
by an increasing number of knots.

`updated-experiments.Rmd` contains the source code for the experiments.
